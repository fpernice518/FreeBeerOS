HW4 README

-----------------------------------------

In this current implementation of HW4, we believe we have successfully implemented
the SCAN algorithm and the requested system calls. However, due to a lack of time
we were unable to implement the Buffer Cache in its entirety. We will continue
to work and will upload the final solution if we can before the deadline elapses.

In addition, we believe we have fixed our major problem from HW3 involving the
Read() system call. We now properly take in data from the provided file descriptor
(stdio and other files).

In regards to the current assignment, we provided a script file, "hw4Make.sh"
which should make our test cases easy to compile. simply run the following commands
in a bash shell:

       chmod a+x hw4Make.sh
       ./hw4Make.sh

These commands will compile eight programs; the first six being a master 
program and 5 child programs. The master program performs an Exec() on each of the 
child programs. The other two programs perform a more extensive test of the
system calls and overall functionality. `First` opens `extd` as a file and 
performs various read and write operations.

  The list below illustrates the dependency lists of the tests.

  masterFileSys
  -oneFileSys
  -twoFileSys
  -threeFileSys
  -fourFileSys
  -fiveFileSys  

  first
  -extd

   IMPORTANT: To run the first test in full, you must only execute the 
              master test program and not the child programs. While
              there will be no issues executing the child programs by 
              themselves this will not yield any interesting behavior.

              The following sequence of run configurations should be
              followed for each of the tests:
              
              First Test
              ----------------------------------------------------
                -f

                -cp test/masterFileSys master
                -cp test/oneFileSys one
                -cp test/twoFileSys two 
                -cp test/threeFileSys three 
                -cp test/fourFileSys four 
                -cp test/fiveFileSys five
               
                -d + -x master -lot -ps -d t -d f
              -----------------------------------------------------

              Second Test
              ----------------------------------------------------
                -f

                -cp test/first first
                -cp test/extd extd
               
                -dt -x first -ps -lot
              -----------------------------------------------------

You will be able to see that the SCAN algorithm does indeed work from the
console output. We list the current cylinder as the head passes over it.
