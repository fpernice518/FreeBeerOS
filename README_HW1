We created a latch for threads. The way it is made is to have a count. When the count is 0 it releases all the threads
This is done by using two semaphores.

THe other is was a exchanger for two threads. More than two threads makes no sense 

we partially finished the third part.

The second one we used a very similiar method of holding the the threads until computation is complete




to run you must use -d 1 as arguments inorder to see the output

THe first part will have 3 types of threads dec thread decawait thread and await thread. All are shown to work 

the second part of the program will tell you what thread it is and what its being exchanged with.
